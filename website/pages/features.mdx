# Features

CallApi provides several features. Let's explore them in this section.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Easy Error Handling

CallApi offers unified error handling through an `error` object, which captures both HTTP errors (errors coming as a response from the API) and standard JavaScript errors.

The `error` object contains the following properties:

1. `errorName`: A string indicating the type of error (e.g., 'TypeError', 'SyntaxError', 'HTTPError').
2. `message`: The error message describing what went wrong.
3. `errorData`: The error data, which can be an error response from the API or a standard JavaScript error object.

For `HTTP errors`:

-  `errorName` is set to "HTTPError"
-  An additional `errorData` property contains the error response data from the API.

For `non-HTTP errors` (e.g., TypeError, SyntaxError):

-  `errorName` reflects the specific JavaScript error type (i.e., 'TypeError', 'SyntaxError')
-  The `errorData` property contains the original JavaScript Error object.

This structure allows you to easily identify and handle different types of errors that may occur during API calls.

```js
const { data, error } = await callApi("some-url");

console.log(error.errorName);
console.log(error.message);
// Will reference the would contain the parsed error response data if it is an HTTPError, else it would just reference the corresponding js Error object
console.log(error.errorData);
```

## ‚úîÔ∏è Automatic Requests Cancellation

-  `CallApi` automatically cancels redundant requests which means (No more race conditionsü§©)

`CallApi` uses an internal request management system to ensure that only the most recent request to a given URL is processed. This helps in preventing the dreaded race conditions.

### How This Feature Works in Detail

1. When a request is made, CallApi's internals check if there's an ongoing request to the same URL.
2. If a pending request exists, it's automatically cancelled.
3. Then, the new request is sent.
4. This process is repeated to ensure that only the latest request to that same URL is allowed to proceed.

You can see this in action in the image below:

### Key Takeaways:

-  **Automatic Cancellation**: When multiple requests are made to the same URL in quick succession, `callApi` automatically cancels any pending previous requests, allowing only the latest request to proceed.
-  **Race Condition Prevention**: This mechanism eliminates race conditions that can occur when rapid, successive API calls are made, such as during fast typing in a search input or multiple button clicks.
-  **Ideal for React Hooks**: This feature is particularly useful when `callApi` is used within React's `useEffect` hook or similar scenarios where component updates might trigger multiple API calls.
-  **Configurable**: If you prefer to handle request management differently, you can disable this feature by setting `{ cancelRedundantRequests: false }` in the fetch options.
-  **Manual Cancellation**: You can manually cancel requests to a specific URL using the cancel method attached to `callApi`. You can also pass an abort controller signal to `callApi` (just like with `fetch`) as an option and abort the request whenever you want to.

### Using `callApi.cancel`:

```js copy
callApi("some-url");

callApi.cancel("some-url");
```

### Using `AbortController`:

```js copy
const controller = new AbortController();

callApi("some-url", { signal: controller.signal });

controller.abort();
```

## ‚úîÔ∏è Query search params

You can add query object as an option and `callApi` will create a query string for you automatically.

```js copy
callApi("some-url", {
	query: {
		param1: "value1",
		param2: "to encode",
	},
});

// The above request can be written in Fetch like this:
fetch("url?param1=value1&param2=to%20encode");
```

## ‚úîÔ∏è Content-Type Generation

`CallApi` takes care of setting the `Content-Type` for you based on the body content. Here's how it works:

-  **Automatic Content-Type Setting**: `CallApi` sets the `Content-Type` automatically depending on your body data. Supported data types for this automatic setting include:

   -  Object
   -  Query Strings
   -  FormData

-  **JSON Handling**: If you pass in an object, `CallApi` will set `Content-Type` to `application/json`. It will also `JSON.stringify` your body, so you don't have to do it yourself.

```js copy
callApi.post("some-url", {
	body: { message: "Good game" },
});

// The above request is equivalent to this
fetch("some-url", {
	method: "post",
	headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
	body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Good game" }),
});
```

If you pass in a string, `CallApi` will set `Content-Type` to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

`CallApi` also includes a `toQueryString` method that helps you convert objects to query strings, making it easy to use this option.

```js copy
import { toQueryString } from "@zayne-labs/callapi";

callApi("some-url", {
	method: "POST",
	body: toQueryString({ message: "Good game" }),
});

// The above request is equivalent to this
fetch("some-url", {
	method: "post",
	headers: { "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" },
	body: "message=Good%20game",
});
```

If you pass in a `FormData`, `callApi` will let the native fetch function handle the `Content-Type`. Generally, this will use `multipart/form-data` with the default options.

```js copy
const data = new FormData(form.elements);

callApi("some-url", { body: data });
```

## ‚úîÔ∏è Authorization Headers

When using `callApi`, you can conveniently generate Authorization Headers by providing an `auth` property:

-  If you pass in a `string`, typically for tokens, `callApi` will generate a Bearer Auth header.

-  If you pass in an `object`, you have two options:

   -  Use `bearer` to generate a Bearer Auth header.
   -  Use `token` to generate a Token Auth header.

-  Passing a string:

```js
callApi("some-url", { auth: "token12345" });

// Equivalent to the following in fetch:
fetch("some-url", {
	headers: { Authorization: `Bearer token12345` },
});
```

-  Passing an object:

```js
// For Bearer Auth
callApi("some-url", { auth: { bearer: "token12345" } });

// Or

// For Token Auth
callApi("some-url", { auth: { token: "token12345" } });

// Equivalent to the following in fetch:

// For Bearer Auth
fetch("some-url", {
	headers: { Authorization: `Bearer token12345` },
});

// Or

// For Token Auth
fetch("some-url", {
	headers: { Authorization: `Token token12345` },
});
```

This simplifies handling authorization headers, ensuring your requests are authenticated correctly.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Handling Response

`CallApi` supports all response types offered by the fetch API, such as `json`, `text`, `blob`, `formData`, etc. This means you don't need to manually handle `response.json()`, `response.text()`, `response.formData()`, etc.

You can configure the response type you prefer by using the `responseType` option. By default, it's set to `json`.

```js
// Json (default)
const { data } = await callApi("url", { responseType: "json" });
// Text
const { data } = await callApi("url", { responseType: "text" });
// Blob, etc
const { data } = await callApi("url", { responseType: "blob" });

// Doing this in fetch would imply:
const response = await fetch("some-url");

const data = await response.json(); // Or response.text() or response.blob() etc
```

This simplifies fetching data from responses, allowing you to specify the format you want directly.
