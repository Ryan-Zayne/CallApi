# Getting Started

## Installation

To install CallApi, you have a couple of options:

### Using npm (recommended)

First, run this command to install:

```js npm2yarn copy
npm install @zayne-labs/callapi
```

Once that's done, you can import it into your JavaScript file like this:

```js filename="app.js"
import { callApi } from "@zayne-labs/callapi";
```

### Without npm

If you prefer not to use npm, you can import CallApi directly into your JavaScript files via a CDN.

To do this, you first need to set your `script`'s type to `module`, then import `callApi`.

```html
<script type="module">
	import { callApi } from "https://esm.run/@zayne-labs/callapi";
</script>
```

You might also want to lock the version you're using. You can do that like this:

```html
<script type="module">
	import { callApi } from "https://esm.run/@zayne-labs/callapi@0.3.2";
</script>
```

## Usage

**Wondering how to start using CallApi? It's simple!**

You can use `callApi` just like the native `fetch` function. The cool part is that you don't have to handle the response yourself. You can just destructure the data and error directly.

-  All the options for the native fetch are supported, so you can use the same syntax to make requests.

```js
const { data, error } = await callApi("url", fetchOptions);
```

-  You also have access to the response object itself via destructuring:

```js
const { data, error, response } = await callApi("url", fetchOptions);
```

For additional convenience with autocomplete, check out how to use CallApi with TypeScript in the [TypeScript section](/advanced#usage-with-typescript).
