# Quick Start

Wondering how to start using CallApi? It's simple!

You can use `callApi` just like the native `fetch` function. The cool part is that you don't have to handle the response yourself. You can just destructure the data and error directly.

-  All the options for the native fetch are supported, so you can use the same syntax to send requests.

```js
const { data, error } = await callApi("url", fetchOptions);
```

-  You also have access to the response object itself via destructuring:

```js
const { data, error, response } = await callApi("url", fetchOptions);
```

For additional convenience with autocomplete, check out how to use CallApi with TypeScript in the [TypeScript section](/usage#typescript).
