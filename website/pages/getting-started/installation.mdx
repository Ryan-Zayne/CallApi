# Installation

To install CallApi, you have a couple of options:

### Using npm (recommended)

First, run this command to install:

```js npm2yarn copy
npm install @zayne-labs/callapi
```

Once that's done, you can import it into your JavaScript file like this:

```js filename="bulaba.js"
import { callApi } from "@zayne-labs/callapi";
```

### Without npm

If you prefer not to use npm, you can import CallApi directly into your JavaScript files via a CDN. Just add this script tag to your HTML:

```html
<script type="module">
	import { callApi } from "https://esm.run/@zayne-labs/callapi";
</script>
```

You might also want to lock the version you're using. You can do that like this:

```html
<script type="module">
	import { callApi } from "https://esm.run/@zayne-labs/callapi@0.3.2";
</script>
```

**Just a quick note:** Your script needs to be of type `module` for this to work.
